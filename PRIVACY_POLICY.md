# Privacy Policy — Robot Management System

## What Personal Data Is Collected

This system collects the minimum amount of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) necessary to operate a secure Ground Control Station. Specifically, the following data is recorded: usernames, email addresses (for authentication), user roles (Viewer or Commander), timestamps of all actions performed, and the details of every command sent to the robot (command type, coordinates, issuing user). IP addresses may also be logged as part of standard server access logs.

## Why This Data Is Collected

All personal data is collected strictly to satisfy the safety and audit requirements of the Ground Control Station. The mission logging (audit trail) records every command issued to the robot along with the user responsible, enabling full traceability in the event of an incident or accident investigation. User authentication and role data are required to enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring that only authorised personnel with the "Commander" role can issue movement commands to the robot.

## How This Data Is Secured

Access to the audit log is restricted via Role-Based Access Control, limiting visibility to users with appropriate privileges. User passwords are securely hashed and never stored in plaintext. The system follows the principle of data minimisation as mandated by GDPR — no data beyond what is required for authentication, authorisation, and safety auditing is collected or retained. Data retention periods will be defined in line with organisational policies, and users may request the deletion of their personal data in accordance with GDPR's "right to erasure" provisions.
