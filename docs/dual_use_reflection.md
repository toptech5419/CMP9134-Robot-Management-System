# Dual Use Implications

The Robot Management System functions as a Ground Control Station for an autonomous unit, a category of technology with significant dual use potential. If an unauthorised actor were to gain "Commander" access, the consequences could be severe. The attacker could redirect the robot into restricted or hazardous areas, potentially causing physical harm to workers, damaging warehouse infrastructure, or disrupting critical operations. In a real-world deployment beyond this simulation, a compromised control station could be exploited for surveillance, sabotage, or even weaponisation of the autonomous unit, particularly if the robot operates in sensitive environments such as military facilities or public spaces.

The system design incorporates several safeguards to mitigate these risks. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforces strict separation between "Viewer" and "Commander" roles, ensuring that only explicitly authorised personnel can issue movement commands. Secure authentication with hashed passwords prevents credential theft, while the Mission Logging audit trail records every command with timestamps and user identification, enabling full traceability and accountability. These logs serve as a deterrent against misuse and provide forensic evidence in the event of a security breach. However, no system is impenetrable, and ongoing vigilance through regular security audits and access reviews remains essential.
