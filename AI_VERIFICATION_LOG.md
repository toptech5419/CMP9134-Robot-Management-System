# AI Verification Log

This log tracks significant instances of AI usage during the development of the Robot Management System, as required by Assessment 1 (Appendix A).

| Task Category | AI Tool Used | Prompt Summary | Verification & Modification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Validate Acceptance Criteria for "Send Navigation Commands" | Claude Opus 4.6 | "Act as the Chief Safety Officer for a warehouse deploying a new Virtual Robot Management System. Review the User Story 'Send Navigation Commands' and its Acceptance Criteria. Are there any safety, security, or usability edge cases I missed? Is the language clear enough for a non-technical stakeholder to approve?" | AI suggested 5 improvements: (1) confirmation dialog before move, (2) emergency stop button, (3) concurrent command handling, (4) network timeout during movement, (5) clearer response time language. I accepted suggestions 1, 2 and adapted them into acceptance criteria. I rejected suggestion 3 (concurrent commands) as the API handles this server-side — the robot finishes its current move before accepting new ones. I refined suggestion 5 to specify "acknowledge within 2 seconds". |
| Validate Acceptance Criteria for "Send Navigation Commands" (Operator Persona) | Claude Opus 4.6 | "Act as a Non-Technical Warehouse Operator. Review the same User Story and Acceptance Criteria. Are there usability edge cases I missed? Is the language clear?" | AI suggested: (1) explain STUCK reason and suggest actions, (2) click-on-grid alternative to typing coordinates, (3) clear message when battery is 0%, (4) separate user-facing criteria from technical details. I accepted suggestions 1 and 3, adding them as new acceptance criteria. I noted suggestion 2 (click-on-grid) as a future enhancement but not a core requirement for MVP. Suggestion 4 was noted for report writing — technical terms will be explained in the user documentation. |
